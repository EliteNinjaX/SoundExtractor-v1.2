This extracts sound dat/idx files for the Video Games Total War Rome, and Medieval 2 Total war. I did not create this, but there seams to be no other link besides the one I created in my personal google drive. That seams not the be the best idea, in case I delete it on accident, so I am posting it here so it harder to lose.
